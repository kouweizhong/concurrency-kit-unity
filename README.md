The Concurrency Kit is a .NET / Mono developer library based on the [Task Parallel Library](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd460717.aspx) and extends it to support [Fibers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber_(computer_science)), [Coroutines](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coroutine), and [Unity](http://unity3d.com/).

This project wraps the C# kit in a Unity Asset.
